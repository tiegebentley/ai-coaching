## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - Phase 1: Broad Vision Exploration

**Description:** Exploring provocative questions to expand the vision of predictive capabilities in youth soccer program management

#### Ideas Generated:

1. **Predictive Schedule Conflict Resolution**
   - AI system analyzes coach availability patterns, event history, and external factors
   - Automatically detects potential scheduling conflicts before they're finalized
   - Suggests optimal coach assignments based on expertise, availability, and workload balancing

2. **Smart Coach Assignment System**  
   - Tracks coach specialties, performance history, and availability patterns
   - Recommends optimal coach-to-event matching based on event requirements
   - Considers coach development goals and experience distribution

3. **Automated Payment Tracking & Prediction**
   - Monitors payment patterns and due dates across all events
   - Predicts which families may have payment delays based on historical data
   - Automatically sends personalized reminders at optimal times
   - Flags potential collection issues before they become problems

#### Insights Discovered:
- Schedule conflicts and payment tracking are interconnected operational challenges
- Coach management involves both resource allocation and professional development
- Predictive capabilities could transform reactive management into proactive leadership

#### Notable Connections:
- Payment tracking patterns could inform scheduling decisions (families with outstanding dues might need different communication approaches)
- Coach assignment optimization could reduce conflicts and improve program quality
- Event-based dues collection creates complex tracking requirements that could benefit from automation

4. **Simple Schedule Organization System**
   - Clean, organized schedule view with coach assignments
   - Easy drag-and-drop coach assignment to events
   - Basic conflict detection (double-booking prevention)

5. **Email Response Assistant**
   - AI agent that helps draft responses to common parent/coach inquiries
   - Template-based responses that can be customized
   - Context from Airtable data to personalize responses

#### Key Insight: Start Simple
- Focus on core pain points: schedule organization and email management
- Build foundation that can grow into more sophisticated features later
- Prioritize immediate usability over complex predictive capabilities

6. **One-Click Email Response System**
   - Main AI assistant that handles all common parent/coach inquiries
   - Automatically pulls context from Airtable (family info, payment status, schedule data)
   - Generates personalized responses for review and sending

7. **Common Email Types to Automate:**
   - Schedule inquiries ("When is my child's next game?")
   - Payment questions ("What do I owe for the tournament?")
   - Event logistics ("Where is practice this week?")
   - Team roster changes ("My child can't make it to...")
   - General program questions ("How does registration work?")

- Gmail communications
- Director's schedule/calendar

**Web Scraping Targets:**
- Club information and updates
- Tournament schedules and details
- Coaching tips and resources for parents
- Youth soccer news and opportunities
- Helpful parenting articles
- Coaching philosophies and methodologies
- League websites and rule updates

#### Ideas Generated:

8. **Intelligent Web Content Curation**
   - AI agents that continuously scrape relevant soccer resources
   - Categorize content by relevance (coaching tips, parent resources, opportunities)
   - Automatically compile weekly/monthly newsletters for parents

9. **Dynamic Knowledge Base**
   - Auto-updating repository of club info, tournament details, coaching resources
   - RAG system that can answer parent questions using scraped content
   - Knowledge graph connecting related concepts (tournaments → teams → coaching tips)

10. **Content-Aware Email Assistance**
    - AI can suggest relevant articles/tips when responding to parent emails
    - "By the way, here's a great article about..." additions to responses
    - Context-driven resource recommendations

#### Branch 2: AI Agents Architecture

**Main Orchestrator: "Director Assistant"**
- Routes requests to appropriate sub-agents
- Coordinates multi-step tasks
- Learns communication style and preferences

**Priority 1: Email Agent (Most Important)**
- Database-connected email response system
- Queries Airtable for relevant family/team/payment/schedule data
- Drafts contextual replies with real-time information lookup
- Maintains conversation history and context

**Supporting Sub-Agents:**
- **Schedule Agent** - Calendar management and coach assignments
- **Scraper Agent** - Web content gathering and knowledge base updates
- **Data Agent** - Airtable integration and database queries
- **Payment Agent** - Dues tracking and reminder automation
- **Newsletter Agent** - Weekly/monthly content compilation
- **Research Agent** - On-demand information gathering

#### Ideas Generated:

11. **Database-Connected Email Intelligence**
    - Email agent automatically identifies sender and pulls their complete profile
    - Real-time data lookup: "Johnny's team practices Tuesdays at 6pm, next game is Saturday at Riverside Field"
    - Payment status integration: "Your current balance is $75 for the spring tournament"
    - Historical context: "Following up on our conversation about..."

12. **Smart Email Drafting Workflow**
    - Agent analyzes incoming email intent and context
    - Queries relevant database tables for current information
    - Generates draft response with data-driven personalization
    - User reviews, edits, and sends with one click

#### Branch 3: User Interfaces

**Primary Interface: Dashboard-Centered Design**
- User preference: Dashboard person - wants everything visible at a glance
- Next.js frontend deployed on Vercel
- Clean, organized visual layout for quick decision making

#### Ideas Generated:

13. **Soccer Program Command Dashboard**
    - **Email Queue Section** - New messages with AI-generated draft responses ready for review
    - **Schedule Overview** - Calendar view with coach assignments and conflict alerts
    - **Quick Action Buttons** - One-click operations ("Send payment reminders", "Generate newsletter")
    - **Agent Status Panel** - Shows what each sub-agent is currently working on
    - **Data Summary Cards** - Payment status, upcoming events, coach availability at a glance

14. **Dashboard Workflow Design**
    - Morning glance: See overnight emails, today's schedule, urgent items
    - One-click email approval: Review draft → Edit if needed → Send
    - Drag-and-drop schedule management: Assign coaches to events visually
    - Real-time updates: Dashboard refreshes as agents complete tasks

15. **Information Architecture**
    - **Left Panel:** Navigation and quick actions
