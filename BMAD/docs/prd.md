# Youth Soccer Program AI Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Reduce Youth Soccer Program Director's manual management time by 60% through AI-powered email automation
• Automate 90% of routine email inquiries with contextually accurate, database-connected responses  
• Provide real-time dashboard visibility into program status, email queue, and outstanding items
• Enable proactive program management through intelligent data integration and automated workflows
• Create scalable foundation for predictive analytics and advanced workflow automation

### Background Context

This system addresses the critical operational challenges facing youth soccer program directors who currently spend excessive time on repetitive email responses, manual schedule coordination, and fragmented data management. The Director manages multiple data sources (Gmail, Airtable, various websites) but lacks integration, resulting in time-consuming context switching and reactive management.

The proposed multi-agent AI system transforms this reactive approach into proactive, data-driven leadership by connecting existing data sources with intelligent automation. The foundation leverages a RAG-powered knowledge base, real-time database integration, and specialized AI agents to deliver contextual responses while maintaining the Director's oversight and control.

### Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH:**
- **Data Migration Strategy**: Need specific procedures for synchronizing existing Airtable data during system implementation
- **Error Recovery Workflows**: Should specify detailed error handling for multi-agent coordination failures

**MEDIUM:**
- **User Research Validation**: PRD based on strong project brief but could benefit from direct user interviews
- **Performance Monitoring Details**: Specific monitoring metrics and alerting thresholds need definition

**LOW:**
- **Mobile User Flows**: Additional detail on mobile workflow optimization would improve completeness
- **Content Moderation Policies**: Guidelines for managing inappropriate scraped content

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Appropriateness: OPTIMAL**
- Epic 1 (Foundation) appropriately minimal while enabling all subsequent functionality
- Epic 2 (Email Agent) delivers core 60% time savings goal - perfect MVP focus
- Epic 3-4 logical progression without scope creep
- Clear separation between must-have and nice-to-have features

**Timeline Realism: ACHIEVABLE**
- 12-16 week timeline for 4 epics is realistic for AI agent complexity
- Foundation-first approach reduces technical risk in later epics
- Story sizing appropriate for AI agent execution capabilities

### Technical Readiness

**Architecture Clarity: EXCELLENT**
- Clear technology stack decisions with rationale
- Detailed integration requirements for Gmail, Airtable, OpenAI APIs
- Vector database architecture well-specified
- Multi-agent coordination patterns defined

**Technical Risk Management: COMPREHENSIVE** 
- Rate limiting requirements clearly specified for all external APIs
- Performance targets realistic and measurable
- Security considerations (OAuth, encryption) properly addressed
- Known complexity areas (vector search, agent coordination) flagged appropriately

### Critical Deficiencies

**None identified that would block architect progress**

Minor gaps in cross-functional requirements (data migration procedures) can be addressed during implementation without impacting architectural decisions.

### Recommendations

1. **Before Architecture Phase**: Define specific data migration procedures for Airtable synchronization
2. **During Epic 1**: Establish detailed monitoring metrics and alerting thresholds 
3. **During Epic 2**: Conduct user validation interviews to confirm workflow assumptions
4. **Ongoing**: Document error recovery procedures as multi-agent coordination patterns are implemented

### Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The foundation-first approach, clear technical constraints, and detailed story breakdown provide excellent guidance for system architecture and implementation.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Based on this comprehensive PRD for the Youth Soccer Program AI Management System, please proceed to **create architecture mode** focusing on user experience design. Key areas for UX architecture: **Dashboard-centered workflow optimization** with emphasis on one-click email approval workflow, drag-and-drop schedule management interface, and real-time status visibility. Prioritize **information hierarchy for quick decision-making** and **mobile-responsive design** for on-the-go program management. The UI goals section provides detailed guidance on interaction paradigms and core screen requirements.

### Architect Prompt  

This PRD is **architect-ready** for **create architecture mode**. Focus on **multi-agent coordination architecture** with Orchestrator pattern, **RAG system implementation** using Supabase pgvector, and **real-time integration architecture** for Gmail webhooks and Airtable API coordination. Technical assumptions section provides detailed technology stack guidance, performance requirements, and integration constraints. Epic 1 stories define the critical foundation infrastructure that enables all subsequent agent functionality. Begin with database schema design and agent communication patterns as the architectural foundation.
